This is a project that I work on very sporadically when I have the time and energy to do so. In the past, development has ceased for entire months at a time. This is just a hobby of mine, and so time gets spent where I think is interesting. Much of the code may be very messy or inefficient, but if it's working for me then it may not get worked on.

# Building / Running

#### NixOS
- Just clone and ./run

#### Everyone Else
- Make sure you have SDL2 and GLEW installed
- Optionally, install gdb
- ./run
