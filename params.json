  "body": "This is a project that I work on very sporadically when I have the time and energy to do so. In the past, development has ceased for entire months at a time. This is just a hobby of mine, and so time gets spent where I think is interesting. Much of the code may be very messy or inefficient. If a piece of code is not hindering me currently, then it may not get worked on, even if it is messy, or there is a better way of doing it.\r\n\r\nRegardless, the code does work, and works moderately well. Blocks has been a great learning experience for me, and I hope that it can help others as well.\r\n\r\n![](http://pleune.github.io/Blocks/screenshots/16-04-11-23-01-49.png)\r\n\r\n## Compiling and running\r\n##### NixOS\r\nI run NixOS. Because of this, I have set up a script to launch a nix-shell with all of the requirements.\r\n\r\n- `git clone https://github.com/Pleune/Blocks`\r\n- `cd Blocks`\r\n- `./run`\r\n\r\n##### Linux\r\n- Make sure `SLD2` `SDL2_tf` and `glew` are installed.\r\n- `git clone https://github.com/Pleune/Blocks`\r\n- `cd Blocks`\r\n- Compile with `make`\r\n- Run with `./bin/blocks`\r\n\r\n\r\n",
